If\nyou have a very large application, this process can consume a large portion of\nyour startup time. By caching the compiled JavaScript files, only those that\nhave been updated must be recompiled, and the rest can be loaded off of the\ndisk. In our usage, this has reduced the startup time from 7s to 2s, which means\na lot when you have to restart your application every time you want to test a\nchange.\n\n## How to use\n\n1. Add to your package.json dependencies and run `npm install` or run `npm install coffee-cache`.\n\n2.  In your entry point file, add the following:\n\n    ```coffee\n    require('coffee-cache')\n    ```\n\n3. That's it. By default the files are cached in the `./.coffee/` directory. If\n   you want to change this, see below.\n\n## Extra configuration\n\nYou can specify the location of the directory to use for the cached files in one\nof two ways:\n\n1. Start the process with the `COFFEE_CACHE_DIR` variable set:\n\n    ```sh\n    $ COFFEE_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/coffee-cache coffee app.coffee\n    ```\n\n2. Use the `setCacheDir` method on the required module:\n\n    ```coffee\n    require('coffee-cache').setCacheDir('../cached/')\n    ```\n\nJust make sure your process has permission to create the necessary folder or\nfiles.\n",
